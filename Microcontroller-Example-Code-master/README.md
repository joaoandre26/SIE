Microcontroller-Example-Code
============================

A personal library of example code created for various microcontroller architectures.

This code doesn't contain any of the project files (or other support files) to get the examples working. These are meant to be copied and pasted into existing projects and to serve as examples for newer projects.

Development boards used:
<ul>
<li>AVR: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11114">Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 3.3V/8MHz</a> (I DO NOT use the Arduino library and software, I prefer to write my own, more efficient firmware with Atmel Studio)</li>
<li>ARM: <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl">Texas Instrument's Tiva C Launchpad</a></li>
<li>PIC32: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9713">USB 32-Bit Whacker by Sparkfun</a></li>
</ul>

For more AVR code, check the Wristboard folder in my Fear-Tracker repository.

For more Tiva C ARM code, check the Processing Hub folder in my Fear-Tracker repository or the Pacman-Game-On-LED-Matrix repository.
